#  Evolving Maze with Swarm Intelligence
---
## Description
The evolving maze project generates a rando maze using a depth-first search approach and updates the maze dynamically with changing walls. Multipe agents are managed by Swarm Intelligence to navigate through the maze using A* algorithem.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone (https://github.com/pallasmorgan/EvolvingMaze.git)
	```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    
    ```sh
    cd Evolvingmaze
    ```
    
3. Install dependencies (if applicable):
    
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # For Python
   
    ```
    

## Usage

Run the program with:

```sh
python boids_opt.py  # Python
```

## Features

1)Implements swarm intelligence for navigating a dynamic maze.

2)Uses the A* algorithm for pathfinding.

3)Real-time visualization using Pygame.

4)Dynamically changing obstacles that force adaptive navigation.

5)Tracks performance metrics such as path cost and collision avoidance.
