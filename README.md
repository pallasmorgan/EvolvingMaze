#  Evolving Maze with Swarm Intelligence
---
## Description
The evolving maze project generates a rando maze using a depth-first search approach and updates the maze dynamically with changing walls. Multipe agents are managed by Swarm Intelligence to navigate through the maze using A* algorithem.

```

## Features

1)Implements swarm intelligence for navigating a dynamic maze.

2)Uses the A* algorithm for pathfinding.

3)Real-time visualization using Pygame.

4)Dynamically changing obstacles that force adaptive navigation.

5)Tracks performance metrics such as path cost and collision avoidance.
